/**
 * Question: Given a string, compress it such as: "aaabb" -> "3a2b".
 * Follow up: If the compressed string's length is longer than orignal one's, no need to compress.
 * 
 * Modification: Suppose the strings are given in a file, and each line only contains one string.
 * You are given 2 functions, hasNext() is going to return a boolean value to tell you if there are more strings in the file;
 * next() will return the next string.
 * 
 * The point of this question is to ask interviewer how to distinguish the following: 113(does it mean 3 11s or 13 1s).
